# raistlic-app-tetris

Swing based tetris game. 
Open source.

# history

Started from a post at tieba.baidu.com?kw=java, I wrote this thing mainly for fun, and to experiment some theories in Swing MVC design.

Originaly served in my other repo: https://bitbucket.org/raistlic/apptetris

But now I think it might be better to put all things that I want to share in one place.

# install & run

- clone the repo
- open it in your favorate IDE
- find the main class and run it.

# what can be improved

Well, a lot can be improved, but I probably won't have much time on this project anymore. 

In particular, I think refactors can be done to add more sophisticated DI, and starting from there, the program will probably scale better and more functionalities can then be added in.

# make your own

The program is small enough, yet it shows some basic concept and structure of how a Swing based 2D frame-per-second game looks like. Especially the painting part, the MVC design, and the threading model. If you are a Java fan like I am, and you want to make your own little game, I hope the project can help you.
